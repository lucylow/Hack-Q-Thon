## Motivation
Traditionally, diagnosing a patient’s condition has been based heavily on the umbrella approach, which is based basically on the patient-reported symptoms, resulting in an umbrella diagnosis and treatment that frequently fails to achieve their intended effects due to individual variability. To exemplify that, just in Europe these failures are responsible for up to 200.000 people deaths each year. In addition, this classical approach is tremendously time consuming and expensive. Precision medicine aims to allow tailor prevention and treatment with an individual approach. Due to the complexity of human biology, individualized medicine requires taking into account aspects that go well beyond standard medical care. In fact, medical care only has a relative contribution of 10 to 20 percent to outcomes; health-related behaviors, socioeconomic factors, and environmental aspects account for the other 80 to 90 percent. The main role of precision medicine is identifying and explaining relationships among interventions and treatments on the one hand—and outcomes on the other— in order to provide the next-best medical action at the individual level. These can leave us for more accurate, earlier and more granular results. With that in mind, how to collect and work with that amount of relevant data needed in a quantum computing model system to help to optimize the medicine approach on day-a-day use?

Diagnosing a patient correctly has always been a long and arduous, that depends on unreliable anecdotal data, such as patient-reported symptoms and vague familial data. This causes the misdiagnosis, or the prescription of ineffective medicine. This umbrella diagnosis and prescription is responsible for up to 200.00 people deaths each year. The use of personalized medicine seeks to resolve/attenuate this through consideration of individual variations such as differences in their genome, proteome, and exposome (takes into consideration their lifestyle, health history, etc..). This goes beyond standard medical due to the logistics involved, not only in collecting the data necessary but also in the processing of the data in a relevant way to prevent and treat the disease. To that effect, the role of precision medicine is to consider the patient at an individual level, using a multitude of factors, to produce an optimum solution that is tailored to them at that moment. This not only alleviates the repercussions of umbrella diagnoses, but also takes some of the burden off of healthcare workers who are experiencing burnout and declining mental health. The use of traditional machine learning has helped the progression of precision medicine but is coming to its limit as the number of health related variables increase. How can we use quantum computing to aid this cause, and emphasize the interplay of health risk factors in the progression of disease?
